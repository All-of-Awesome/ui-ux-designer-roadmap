> Roadmap to becoming a UI/UX Designer in 2017

Below, you'll find a roadmap on how to become a UI/UX designer. It lists all common tools of the trade in order to become a digital creative. It is inspired by [this roadmap on how to become a web developer](https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap).

If you have any improvements, don't hesitate to post an [issue](https://github.com/togiberlin/designer-roadmap/issues) or make a [pull request](https://github.com/togiberlin/designer-roadmap/pulls) ðŸ™ƒ

## ðŸš€ Introduction
Often times, people use the terms ```UI``` and ```UX``` interchangeably. Despite some shared elements, there are notable differences. Here is a simple definition:

- When people say __UI__, they usually mean everything related to graphic design, colors, fonts, backgrounds, buttons etc.
- When people say __UX__, they usually mean tasks related to psychology, human decision making, user research, personas, user stories, workflows, A/B testing, statistics and so on.

Here, you see the common characteristics which both UI and UX people are expected to bring to the table:

## ðŸŽ¨ User Interface Designer Roadmap
The tools of the trade for UI design are mainly [Sketch](https://www.sketchapp.com/), [Adobe XD](http://www.adobe.com/de/products/experience-design.html), [Adobe Photoshop](http://www.adobe.com/de/products/photoshop.html) and [Adobe Illustrator](http://www.adobe.com/de/products/illustrator.html). Some UI designers also code HTML and CSS at work, so I've included it too.

## ðŸ”® User Experience Researcher Roadmap
The main focus of ```UX``` is to get the __psychology__ right. According to [Business Insider](http://www.businessinsider.de/average-number-of-apps-vs-time-spent-2016-5?r=US&IR=T), the average U.S. citizen spends around 40 minutes daily on a smartphone. On average, 27 apps (!) are competing for these 40 minutes. In a world full of distractions, attention has become the most precious resource. **Mental resources** are limited and highly contested. At the same time, app stores are [incredibly crowded](http://www.businessinsider.com/top-app-store-marketing-tips-2-2014-2?IR=T), and it keeps getting worse. [Research](http://andrewchen.co/new-data-shows-why-losing-80-of-your-mobile-users-is-normal-and-that-the-best-apps-do-much-better/) found out, that on average 80% of users delete apps within the first 3 days. With these abnormally high __churn rates__, delivering the standard "good usability and user experience" line is simply not enough. For the competitive edge, apps need to be addictive. This can be achieved by state-of-the-art UX patterns and psychology. E.g. according to the [Daily Mail](http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2785744/Facebook-Instagram-favourite-social-network-teens.html), Instagram overtook Facebook in popularity - because the founders of Instagram got the psychology right.

> "In 2006, two students in [BJ Foggâ€™s Stanford class on "Persuasive Technology"](https://bjfogg.com/) collaborated on a project called Send the Sunshine. Their insight was that one day mobile phones (this was the pre-smartphone era) would be used to send emotions: if your friend was in a place where the weather wasnâ€™t good and you were standing in sunshine, your phone could prompt you to take a picture and send it to them to cheer them up. One of the two students, Mike Krieger, went on to co-found Instagram, where over 400m users now share sunrises, sunsets and selfies."<br><br>Referenced from [https://www.1843magazine.com/features/the-scientists-who-make-apps-addictive](https://www.1843magazine.com/features/the-scientists-who-make-apps-addictive)

Instagram achieved this success by reducing the clutter and feature bloat of Facebook. Users always follow the path of least resistance. And by making Instagram more simple, direct and faster, the path of least resistance becomes the default path. Here one example:

> It was a regular Monday evening in Chicago. David H. was bored. To relieve his boredom, David H. opened his Instagram to check the news feed. He saw his friend Jason F. surfing in Hawaii. After commenting, he continued to check the news feed. Without noticing, he spent 30 minutes on Instagram.

Instagram has a sneaky UX pattern called **Autoplay**. If you do nothing, Instagram keeps loading new content. The path of least resistance - doing nothing - leads to using Instagram more, not less. With time, using Instagram becomes a subconscious, deeply embedded **habit**. And building habits is what you ultimately want, because they are so hard to unlearn.

With these examples, it should be clear that UX is an critical part of app success and user retention. Without further ado, here now the UX roadmap:

![UX Researcher Roadmap](http://i.imgur.com/duKBzNL.png)

To augment above mentioned UX buzzwords, scroll down to the next chapter to see practical, real-life examples on successful UX.

## UX Pattern Examples
Modern apps make heavy usage of **nudges**. A nudge is a soft intervention for gently pushing a user into a specific action or behavior - without any coercion or force. Nudge theory has been applied with success for influencing e.g. government policy. For example, the British government employs [a dedicated nudge unit](http://www.behaviouralinsights.co.uk/) to gently push unsuspecting citizens into specific decisions. Nudges are also used in web and mobile apps. Nudges shouldn't trick users into behaviors which they do not want. Ideally, nudges are used to help users achieve something which they already want to do. For example, [FitBit](https://www.fitbit.com/de/home) helps users to achieve their fitness goals. Another example is [Habitica](https://habitica.com/static/front), which helps you to learn positive habits and unlearn negative habits in form of a gamified role play game. This kind of **digital paternalism** is becoming more popular and can transform users into the best versions of themselves. Below are some positive as well as sneaky examples of nudges:

> Annie installed the new fitness app on her phone and as has been working out for a few weeks. It has worked well, because the main dashboard shows a calendar with her active days marked in orange. She is encouraged to keep a streak. If she misses a day, the streak is lost. Annie has worked out for 2 weeks straight and has never missed a day.

This nudge is making use of our human desire for **order**. Humans perceive **symmetry** as beautiful, and subconsciously crave to keep it that way.

> Jason had a long day at university, furthermore he had a football match in the evening. After the match, he wearily fell into bed. All of a sudden, his phone made some noise. He looked at the screen and saw that Facebook messenger had a message ready for him. Could it be that Jessica, his secret crush, has answered to his date proposal? Jason jumped up and opened Facebook Messenger. Nope, it turned out that his buddies were having some beers and invited him.

This nudge is making use of human **curiosity**. It is important, to always stay unpredictable in order to increase excitement. As soon as things become predictable, it becomes boring. By keeping the **reward variable**, more users will be prompted to check regularly. This is very easily done by feeding user generated content. Machine learning algorithms (e.g. association rules) can be used to deliver content which matches the user's field of interests.

> Roseanne decided to lose some weight and get fit. She installed the Nike+ app. When the app started for the first time, it asked Roseanne to connect the app with her Facebook account. She agreed. She was eager and curious to try the app.

**Defaulting** can happen by in-your-face prompts and notifications ("Do you want to allow Nike+ to connect to your Facebook account? Yes/No"). To make it more sneaky, the yes-checkbox should be ticked by default and be substantially larger than the no-checkbox. Make sure to avoid **choice overload** by presenting not more than 3-4 options. Whatever the user chooses, it will be in your favor. The art of presenting choices is called **choice architecture**. Make sure that the desired action is the path of least resistance.

> After successful Nike+ and Facebook, Roseanne started a run. The run was posted on Roseanne's Facebook wall by default. Her family, friends and coworkers saw that post and were staggered. After all, Roseanne was heavily obese.

This nudge makes use of **social accountability**. When we announce our goals to people, we are more likely to stick to this goal, as we don't want to lose respect from our peers.

> As soon as Roseanne was finished with her run, she saw that Peter and Lois were also doing runs on Nike+. She found out in the rankings screen, that Peter's average activity was above hers by 30%. But Peter is even more obese than Roseanne! And if he can do it, why can't Roseanne?

This nudge makes use of **peer comparison**. People are usually happy. Until they start to compare...then they become unhappy.

> Jeremy opened the app store and was looking for a diet tracking app. He saw 5 listed apps. One of them had over 50k ratings and over 350k downloads. If 350,000 people have downloaded the app, it can't be that bad. Jeremy checked the user reviews. All of them were either 4 or 5 stars. "Nice, the app can't be that bad" he thought. In the app description, he could see that his big idol Kanye is also using this app. "Kanye is using this app, too? Damn, I need this app, ASAP!"

This nudge is making use of **social proof**. Social proof takes advantage of the human herd instinct. We perceive things to be trustworthy, if other people do it too. If advertised with celebrities, it can become even more powerful.

> Howard has the habit to read newspaper magazines in the morning with a coffee. However, his old subscription of the "Daily Mail" has just ended recently. He was interested in picking up the "Economist". ![Economist Phantom Pricing](http://futurestartup.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/untitled-12.jpg)<br>
He saw the pricing table: "a digital subscription costs me 59 USD. But the print subscription costs me 125 USD. Okay...wait a minute! I get the print edition for 125 USD AND the digital edition for free? That's a bargain, naturally I'll pick the third option."
<br><br>_Referenced from http://futurestartup.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/untitled-12.jpg_

This sneaky pricing pattern is called **Phantom Pricing**. Why? Because the middle one is the phantom. It is just a dummy, a fake, a decoy - to make the third option more attractive.

> Back in 2010, one of the most outstanding features of the new iPhone 4 was FaceTime. FaceTime allowed you to make videocalls and stay in contact with loved ones. Despite disappointed press coverage - after all, Skype had been around for 7 years - people gathered in front of Apple stores in masses to snatch the iPhone 4.

This UX pattern is making use of **emotional branding** by building strong **mental associations**. Human brains store information in form of a network. If we want to recall information of a certain node, specific paths are activated. With **association marketing**, you can enrich e.g. the "iPhone 4" node with certain characteristics and emotions. Apple achieved this with a brilliant, highly [emotional ad on FaceTime](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKoLp_lGo14). In this clip, you can see e.g. a deployed soldier seeing his newborn baby via FaceTime. Emotions are strong, because they have the power to circumvent rational thinking.

## Understanding Human Decision Making
Above mentioned UX patterns show, that a *homo oeconomicus* doesn't always make decisions based on intellect and reason. Emotions, biases, associations, "gut feeling" and the unreasonable do play a huge role in decision making. Psychologists have classified human thinking modes into a **slow thinking mode** and a **fast thinking mode**, also known as Dual Process Theory.

### Dual Process Theory
- The **slow thinking mode** is applied when encountering unusual situations, which require intensive thought. Example: deciding between two video editing software, which both do exactly the same and cost the same. You are probably trying come to a decision based on popularity, UI aesthetics, YouTube app reviews, testimonials, blog entries, friends opinion etc. Once you gathered all necessary information, you make the decision to buy.

- The **fast thinking mode** is applied when facing familiar situations, which you already encountered in the past. The brain stores common routines for familiar situations and tries to *automate* the decision making in order to save mental resources. Example: you get another annoying newsletter from a forum where you registered. Without opening or reading it, you immediately delete the email.

The figure below shows the Spectrum of Thinking Interventions by Stephen Wendel. By repeating actions, e.g. heuristics move further to the left and become habits.

### Nir Eyal's Hook Model
![Nir Eyals Hook Model](http://i.imgur.com/xM2O614.png)

When actions are repeatedly done, they become a habit. A habit is a hardwired routine, which costs very little mental resources, is easy to do and very hard to unlearn. Nir Eyal's Hook model explains perfectly, how habits can be formed. Let's come back to our Instagram example:

- **External Triggers**: Instagram notifies Peter, when his friends start e.g. a live feed. Also, whenever someone drops a comment on Peters photos, Instagram sends immediate **push notifications**.

- **Internal Triggers**: Peters constant usage of Instagram is hardwired into his brain. Whenever he felt bored, he automatically opened his Instagram to relieve his boredom. In his mind, getting rid of boredom is now **associated** with Instagram.

- **Ability**: Peter feels proud, because he has 22k followers. It means, that his content, personality and hobbies and worthy of attention. It makes him proud and motivates him to use Instagram on a daily basis, because he craves **social acceptance**. The famous watch manufacturer Daniel Wellington became aware of Peter's status and offered him a lucrative deal: he advertises DW watches, and get's a percentage of the purchase. Instagram offers Peter a great opportunity to get **money**. This motivation keeps Peter for at least an hour occupied on Instagram, every day.

- **Variable Reward**: Peter has great interest in bodyweight exercises. He follows some calisthenics celebrities on Instagram. He is always searching for new ways to improve his workouts. At the same time, he wants to track his progress with his Daniel Wellington watch sales. He never knows, what type of new content he will encounter. This thin veil of mystery - the **variable reward** - keeps Peter coming back to Instagram.

- **Investment**: Peter was a heavily obese person. He started posting his progress on Instagram. Within 2 years, he lost 60 pounds. It felt great, because like-minded people encouraged and pushed him to new heights. The more Peter posts about his progress, the more positive feedback he gets. The more Peter posts about himself, the more he feels **rewarded**.

The more Peter goes through the Hook cycle, the firmer his dependence on Instagram becomes. Now, after 2 years of usage, he can't imagine a life without using Instagram. Using Instagram has become a deeply embedded habit.

### B.J. Foggs Behavior Model
If you want to understand, when a user will or will not do a specific action, you can use BJ Fogg's Behavior Model. Aim to make the desired action easy and cover user motivations.
